## About the game
### Objective
To fly as high as possible until the game ends (game end is going to be probably some max height, going to the moon? / carrying stuff to ISS? / getting a satellite to orbit?)
### Upgrades
You can upgrade your rocket to make it accelerate faster, make the maximum velocity bigger, have more boost, have a bigger magnet to catch more money (make the radar radius bigger?, make the durability better?).  
You can also buy new rockets, which go faster and further?
### Collecting items
As mentioned before, you can collect money. Moreover you can collect fuel to fly higher, the higher you fly the more money as well as fuel you will get.
### Obstacles
To make the game more interesting, the rocket launch site has planes, helicopters and clouds (+ birds?), which make the rocket vulnarable. Furthermore, the higher you get the wilder the flying objects get (weather balloons?, very fast fighter jets?, UFOs?, satellites?, GOD?). There will also be wind, that will push you around for a short period of time. Thunder clouds make your flight computer glitch out (maybe it will happen also when you get higher aka due to radiation?).
